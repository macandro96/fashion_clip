# train-CLIP-FT ðŸ“Ž

A PyTorch Lightning solution to finetuning the released CLIP models

## Dependencies
```bash
pip install 'git+https://github.com/katsura-jp/pytorch-cosine-annealing-with-warmup'
pip install pytorch-lightning
```
 
## Usage ðŸš‚

### Finetuning ðŸš†
To finetune an existing model all you have to do is change the string which specifies which model to load!

```python
clp, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/16", device='cpu')
```

Then simply type the following into your terminal:
```
python train_finetune.py --folder data_dir --batch_size 512
```

For training on GPU/s:
```bash
# 0 is the first GPU, 1 is the second, etc.
python train_finetune.py --folder data_dir --batch_size 512 --gpus 0, 
```

### Training with our DataModule ðŸ“‰

As long as each of the image pairs have the same stem name (i.e. `coco_img1.png` and `coco_img1.txt`) all that you need to do is specify the folder on runtime. Any subfolder structure will be ignored, meaning `foo/bar/image1.jpg` will always find its `myster/folder/image1.txt` so long as they share a common parent folder. All image suffixes will work, the only expectation is that captions are separated by `\n`.

### Traing with you own Data ðŸ“Š

If you have different training needs you may drop in your very own DataLoader. Edit the `train.py` script to you needs by commenting out our DataModule and inserting your own into `trainer.fit(model, your_data)`. The only expectation is that the first item of the return tuple is the image batch, and the second is the text batch.

## Goal âš½

Our aim is to create an easy to use Lightning implementation of OpenAI's clip training script. We want our end product to be as inline with the orignal paper as possible. We will live by:
